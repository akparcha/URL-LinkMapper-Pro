At URL LinkMapper Pro, we take privacy seriously and are committed to ensuring that your personal information is protected. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect the URLs you provide while using our Chrome extension. Please read this carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your data.

1. Information We Collect
1.1 URLs Provided by the User
Our extension only collects URLs that you manually enter or select during the comparison process. This is necessary for the core functionality of the extension, which is to compare old and new URLs and suggest the best match.

2. How We Use the Information
2.1 URL Comparison
The URLs you provide are only used for real-time comparison within the extension. We use this information to match old URLs with new ones and deliver accurate mapping results.

2.2 No Data Storage
We do not store or retain any URLs or data entered into the extension. All URL comparisons are performed locally on your device. Once the comparison process is complete, the data is discarded immediately.

2.3 No Sharing of Data
Since we do not collect, store, or process any personal or sensitive information, we do not share any data with third parties. The extension operates entirely on your local machine without transmitting any data to external servers.

3. Permissions
Our extension may request permissions to access certain data required for the comparison functionality (e.g., access to the URLs). These permissions are solely used for the purpose of comparing and mapping URLs. We do not request or collect any other information beyond what is required for the extension’s operation.

4. Third-Party Services
Our extension does not use any third-party services that track or collect data. As a result, no data is transmitted or exposed to any external parties during the use of the extension.

5. Data Security
We are committed to ensuring that your data remains secure. Since no data is transmitted, processed, or stored externally, there is minimal risk of data exposure. Your privacy is safeguarded through the extension’s local operation on your device.

6. User Rights
As the user of our extension:

You have full control over the URLs you enter into the extension.
You can stop using the extension at any time without concern for data retention, as we do not store any data.
7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in response to changes in legal, regulatory, or operational requirements. Any updates will be posted within the extension’s listing on the Chrome Webstore or other applicable locations. We encourage you to review this page periodically to stay informed of any changes.
